A client to interact with Ollama's LLMs through the local api. Requires Ollama to be installed. Built using WinUI3.

#Usage

This app is still in it's development stage and requires Visual Studio to run. You can install it here: https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/
You will also need to install .NET 9 and the Windows App SDK. A guide on how to do that here: https://developer.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/downloads/windows-sdk/

When you've downloaded all of the pre-requisites, you can download the project using git:
`git clone https://github.com/Chevlanae/OllamaClient.git`

Once you have the project downloaded, open the OllamaClient.sln file, and build/run the project by clicking the green play button on the top ribbon bar.
Make sure that you have "OllamaClient (Package)" selected or else you'll get build errors.
